Software Design and Software Process

Write a Java Swing GUI application that creates a GUI that contains a color combo box (upper left comer) and 
three radio buttons ("Rectangle," "Circle," and "Arc"), two buttons (at the bottom, "Undo" and "Erase") and 
a canvas in cyan color, on which we can draw shapes on.
